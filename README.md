# PythonBinarySearch
 Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the list into two halves and comparing the middle element with the target value. Binary search can be implemented in Python both iteratively and recursively.

To use these functions, you need to pass a sorted list as the first argument, the target value as the second argument, and optionally the low and high indices as the third and fourth arguments for the recursive function.
